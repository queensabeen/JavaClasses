Yet another type of Variables

    1) Local
    2) Instance variables
    3) Static variables

  Local Variables (preferred):
        - any variable that is declared inside a method or a block like:
                                                     - while loop
                                                     - for loop
                                                     - if condition
                                                     - or inside the constructor
        Properties of Local Variables:
              1) we cannot access them outside of the block
                            eg) if (2>1){
                            int x=10; //this variable will not be accessible outside the curly brackets
                            }
              2) when the method is done, these are destroyed and memory (RAM) is freed - efficient memory use


  Instance Variables (discouraged):
        - all of the variables which are declared outside of the methods or block or constructors but inside a class

        Properties of Instance Variables:
              1) memory is allocated inside RAM as soon as the object is created and it stays in the memory
                    until the closing bracket


  Static Variables:
              1) declared outside of the methods, constructors and block of codes with a static keyword


  Access modifiers:
        - keywords that help us to reduce visibility of the variables and methods
        - no one else from other classes or packages can modify our data
              1) private:
                    - if used with variable or method, that variable is only accessible from the same class
                    - we use it to protect critical information that we do not want to expose

                        eg) class Account{
                        private int balance;

                        void depositMoney(){
                            if(boolean properChannel, int money){
                                balance=balance+money
                                }
                            }
                        }

                        class hacker{
                        balance=100000;//CE cannot access

                        }

              2) Default:
                    - not a keyword
                    - it is a behaviour that is assigned to the methods or properties automatically
                      if we are not assigning any access modifier


                        eg) package 1
                        class {
                        String car;
                        }

                        package 2
                        class family{
                        car="I am your little brother. I am using your car today. Forgive me if i destroy it"
                        }

if we do not specify any modifiers, default behaviour will be assigned to our variables and methods and they will
only be available within the same package

              3) public:
                    - if we declare our methods or instance variables, we can access them from any class or package

                    eg) package 1
                       class {
                       public String car;
                       }

                       package 2
                       class family{
                       car="I am a random person. I am using your car today. Forgive me if i destroy it"
                       }
